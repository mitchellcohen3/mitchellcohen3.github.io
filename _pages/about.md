I am completing my Ph.D in robotic perception at McGill University under the
supervision of [Professor James
Forbes](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/james-forbes) in the
[DECAR](https://www.decar.ca/) research group. My research interests are in the
areas of robotic state estimation, simulatenous localization and
mapping (SLAM), computer
vision, and optimization, with a focus on improving
navigation techniques for robots. My current research focuses on the fusion of camera and inertial data
to perform SLAM. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the use of semantic map
representations within visual-inertial state estimation pipelines.

I also recieved a **Master's in Mechanical Engineering** in 2020 from McGill
University, where I focused on developing novel control and state estimation algorithms for both fixed-wing and multirotor UAVs.
